== How to run

This is https://gohugo.io[Hugo]-based blog, so you must install it before working on the source code.
Use your OS's package manager to do that.
E.g. `yaourt -S hugo-bin` will install Hugo on Arch-based distros.

This blog uses https://asciidoc.org[Asciidoc] as a markup language.
You must install a preprocessor to be able to build it.
link:Gemfile[`Gemfile`] is included in this repo to simplify things: just run `bundle install` to install the dependencies.

And do not forget to clone the submodules of this repo!
I believe, `git submodule update --init --recursive` will do the trick.

Finally, run Hugo: `hugo server --watch` and open the link from its output.
