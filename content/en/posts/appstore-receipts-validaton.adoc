Some time ago, I wrote a link:../appstore-receipts-validator-j[blogpost] about my https://gitlab.com/madhead/appstore-receipts-validator-j[Java library for App Store receipts validation].
Recently, I was contacted by another developer working on a server-side App Store receipts validation.
He found my article and then contacted me in Telegram, we had a pretty long conversation and discussed a lot of nuances.
I never thought that receipt validation could be of some interest, but after that conversation I realized how much pain I have expirienced and how much intricacies are there in this task.

So here it is: everything I wish I knew about server-side App Store receipts validation before I did it for the first time.
