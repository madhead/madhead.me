I would say that GitHub Actions are the pinnacle of evolution of CI/CD services.

Although they are really fun to use in your projects, I will target another aspect in this article.
I would like to speak about a few flaws in GitHub Actions architecture that make developing reusable actions not as comfortable as it could be.

<!--more-->

Before I start, I want to emphasize the difference between "Actions" and "actions".
https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions] is a product by GitHub, Inc.
There is no singular form, and the word "GitHub" should not be omitted.
If I do omit it somewhere belowâ€”it's just an accidental typo.
And by "actions" I mean reusable building blocks comprising your workflows.

== My perception of CI/CD evolution

Do you remember building and testing your code with custom scripts (`make` in the best case scenario) on a PC in the darkest corner of your office, labeled with a sticker saying something like "do not shut down"?
I know some projects still do that.

Then we saw Jenkins, who normalized a lot of things, but the jobs were still configured manually.

Then, the pipelines-as-code approach emerged, we saw Jenkins Pipelines and dozen of CI/CD services, like https://www.travis-ci.com[Travis] and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci[GitLab CI/CD], bloomed.
Yeah, I know that Travis is technically a coeval of Jenkinsâ€”both date back to 2011â€”but it's just an example.

And finally we have GitHub Actions.
It is a good old pipelines-as-code solution, but deeply integrated with SCM server.
Contrary to the elder services, who were code-centric, GitHub Actions are repository-centric.
And considering how good GitHub repositories areâ€”I mean all those neat features like https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests[PRs], https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases[Releases], https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues[Issues], https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis[Wikis], https://github.com/features/project-management/[Projects], and https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-github-packages[Packages]â€”this should be enough to sell GitHub Actions to any sane developer!

But they also have the https://github.com/marketplace[Marketplace] and this is insane!

== TODO

Before the Marketplace there was no easy way to share and reuse a piece of build logic.

Jenkins plugins were too difficult to create, share and reuse (trust me, I published https://github.com/jenkinsci/doktor-plugin[one]).
You have no choice but Java to author them.
Then you have to understand some of Jenkins's philosophy and internals, like `hudson.Extension` (it's a shit with a looong history, my friend) descriptors, actions, steps, file access API, and Apache Commons Jelly (BTW it's abandoned).
Jenkins API is a cursed legacy pile!
Then you deal with https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-development/dependencies-and-class-loading[classloaders], and it may be a showstopper.
Finally, you publish your plugin on https://plugins.jenkins.io[plugins.jenkins.io] and users ask their admins to install it.

GitLab CI/CD has an `include` keyword that allows you to reuse pieces of YAML in different projects, but there is no good way to make those pieces visible and searchable to others.
There are templates maintained by GitLab, but to find the link you'll have to read the docs really carefully
Here is the link as a complement: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates[GitLab CI/CD templates].
I am not sure if GitLab team will address this in future, probably this "social aspect" is not on their backlog at all.
As a result, you'll be limited in reusing your own templates, or, as a best case scenario, your company's templates.

This blog is build with GitLab CI/CD (I'm working on it ðŸ˜€) and it https://gitlab.com/madhead.me/madhead.me/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml[takes about 30 lines of YAML] to install https://gohugo.io[Hugo], build the site, and publish it to GitHub Pages.
All this steps are implemented from the ground up with shell commands like `apt install hugo` and so on.
Here is a functionally equivalent piece of GitHub Actions workflow:

[source, yml]
----
- uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
  with:
    hugo-version: '0.81.0'
- run: hugo
- uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./public
----

It's about 4-6 times shorter, and, more important, it's crystal clear and perfectly balanced: not too low-level, not too high-level.
Just somewhere in the middle.

All credits go to https://github.com/peaceiris[Shohei Ueda] who shared these reusable actions with me.
Well, anyone can use `peaceiris/actions-hugo` in their workflows for free!
And they don't need to know Shohei Ueda to reuse their work, just search for "Hugo" actions https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=Hugo[on the Marketplace] and choose the one they like most (probably, by the number of stars):

And there are thousands of Actions waiting to be reused already, and the number link:../semver-utils[is] link:../read-java-properties[growing].
This number is probably already bigger than the number of available Jenkins plugins, although Jenkins plugins tend to be more feature-rich and monolithic, while GitHub Actions follow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy[Unix philosophy] and usually do only one thing per Action.

Are you bored already, because it was only the introduction?
Let me briefly recap it.

GitHubâ€”the most popular source hosting platform in the worldâ€”lauched it's own offering for project & repository automation: GitHub Actions.
Name it a CI / CD solution.
These GitHub Actions are damn good mostly because they provide the best integration with GitHub itself and because of the Marketplace.
And there is a demand on quality reusable Actions on the Marketplace, as both the overall number of projects on GitHub, and the number of projects willing to switch to GitHub Actions, are growing.

And this may lead you to the idea of writing your own Action and publishing it on the Marketplace.

Lucky you, GitHub made it very easy to write and share an Action.
There are https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-actions[two types of Actions]: JavaScript and Docker.
Both use super-simple API for interaction with the environment: there is a JavaScript library to get inputs and provide outputs of an Action and Docker actions just useâ€¦ command-line arguments.
Except that it's just you, a workspace of a project with some files, and a language of your choice: JavaScript or TypeScript for JavaScript Actions and virtually any language supporting being dockerized and command-line arguments for Docker Actions.
Everything is subjective, reality is arbitrary, use your imagination and your skills to do anything.
