Imagine you have a few cool ideas for https://core.telegram.org/bots[Telegram bots].
Bots have two options of communicating with Telegram servers: either by polling the events by using https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates[`getUpdates`] or by registering a https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook[webhook] and receiving the updates as HTTPS POST requests.
But who the heck uses polling today?
Right, nobody does that, and webhooks are the option.

And here be dragons.

[quote, 'https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks[Marvin\'s Marvellous Guide to All Things Webhook]']
____
A webhook needs an open port on your server.
We currently support the following ports: 443, 80, 88 and 8443.
Other ports are not supported and will not work.
Make sure your bot is running on one of those supported ports, and that the bot is reachable via its public address.

A webhook requires SSL/TLS encryption, no matter which port is used.
It's not possible to use a plain-text HTTP webhook.
You shouldn't want to either, for the sake of your bot and users.

It seems that you can only run four bots at max using a single server because they will need to https://stackoverflow.com/q/1694144/750510[have different ports] and Telegram accepts only four port values.

But what if you want to host a dozen of different bots on a single server?
And you'll need TLS.
Managing certificates for every bot would be a headache.

Obviously, you should use a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy[reverse proxy].
This way you'll need to open only one port, let's say 443, and have only one certificate for the host.
The proxy may then route the requests based on their locations.
And when you have a new bot â€” just update the proxy config.

What is the best-known and beloved reverse proxy?
Probably, https://www.nginx.com[NGINX].

What is the best-known and beloved configuration management tool, lightweight enough to be used even in pet projects?
Probably, https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible].

So here is the trick to make an Ansible-friendly NGINX config that is easily extendable, i.e. allows you to add new bots independently as they appear.

[source, yml]
----
# {{ ansible_managed }}

server {
    listen              443 ssl;
    server_name         {{ public_ip }};
    ssl_certificate     /etc/pki/cert.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/pki/key.pem;

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.locations;
}
----

Now, for every new bot you want to run, create a file with `.locations` extension in `/etc/nginx/conf.d`, with a content like this:

[source, yml]
----
# {{ ansible_managed }}

location /{{ bot.telegram.token }} {
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_redirect   off;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
    proxy_pass       http://0.0.0.0:{{ bot.port }}/{{ bot.telegram.token }};
}
----

These files will be included in the "main" NGINX config automatically using the `include` directive!
Now you can deploy your bots independently by simply managing their own `location` blocks without touching the main NGINX configuration.

Finally, if you want to generate a self-signed certificate with Ansible as well, here is the interesting part of the config:

[source, yml]
----
- community.crypto.openssl_privatekey:
    type: RSA
    size: 4096
    path: /etc/pki/key.pem
- community.crypto.openssl_csr:
    subject:
      O: CoolBot
      CN: '{{ public_ip }}'
    privatekey_path: /etc/pki/key.pem
    path: /etc/pki/cert.csr
- community.crypto.x509_certificate:
    privatekey_path: /etc/pki/key.pem
    csr_path: /etc/pki/cert.csr
    provider: selfsigned
    path: /etc/pki/cert.crt
----

This is basically the same as `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.crt -subj "/O=CoolBot/CN=${your_public_ip}"` command found on the Internet.
These Ansible tasks are idempotent, i.e. they won't actually change the certificate if executed multiple times unless one of their parameters changes.

Now go and run some bots for cheap in https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/#always-free[Oracle's "Always Free" VMs]!
