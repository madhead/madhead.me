A short story about a newbie's mistake I've made recently.

<!--more-->

I was implementing an HTTP caching for one of our APIs, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag[based on "ETag" and "If-None-Match"] headers.
The entity I was trying to cache — `Feed` — was simple:

[source, kotlin]
----
data class Feed(
    val deviceId: String,
    val platform: Platform,
    val items: List<FeedItem>
)

enum class Platform {
    IOS, ANDROID
}

data class FeedItem(
    val id: Int
    // Integers and strings
)
----

I decided to use `hashCode()` for ETags.

I knew that both `Integer` and `String` have a well-defined and stable hash code: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html#hashCode()[`Integer#hashCode()`] is equal to the primitive value represented by that `Integer` object, and https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#hashCode()[`String#hashCode()`] uses a known formula.
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#hashCode()[`List#hashCode()`] is stable as well as long as it's elements have stable hash codes.

Of course not, we're not happy!
I forgot to check the details about https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Enum.html#hashCode()[`Enum#hashCode()`] method.

And here be dragons: **enum's hash code is not stable across different JVM instances**.
I assumed wrongly that it is calculated as value's https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Enum.html#ordinal()[`ordinal()`], which is `Integer`, which, we know, has a stable hash code, equal to itself.
But it's not.
Enum's hash code is defined in Java (Kotlin is virtually the same) as:

[source, java]
----
public final int hashCode() {
    return super.hashCode();
}
----

Here, `super` is an `Object`, and, https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()[as we know], ``Object``'s hash code is stable unless the object itself is changed.
It's generally the case with enums: there is only one instance of each of enum's values per JVM and they are stable.
But it's important to emphasize, that it applies to a single JVM.
**Enum's on different JVMs will have different hash codes.**

And that's how our ETags were broken: every time the request landed on a new server, the ETag was different, even if the objects stored in the database were the same.
The situation was worsened by the fact that we were using short-lived JVMs (https://aws.amazon.com/lambda[AWS Lambda functions]), so the caching was completely broken for a while until I tracked down this issue.

RTFM!
