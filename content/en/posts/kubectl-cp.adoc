Do you want to get a binary file from a Kubernetes pod in an highly +++<del>+++hostile+++</del>+++secure environment where you can't use `kubectl cp`?
Read on!

<!--more-->

So, recently I had to get a **huge** and **binary** file (a Java heap dump) from a Kubernetes pod to my local machine for analysis.

At first, I was like: `kubectl cp` will do the job.
But it didn't:

[source, bash]
----
error: Internal error occurred: error executing command in container: failed to exec in container: failed to start exec "8e29deb771408cfd85c171d69a9bb80597e155fe02caddc33009cfc2b8d6b1d7": OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: "tar": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown
----

It turns out that `kubectl cp` relies on `tar` to copy files, what a surprise.
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/58512[Vote] fot the improvement!

[souce, bash]
----
kubectl help cp                                                         
Copy files and directories to and from containers.

Examples:
  # !!!Important Note!!!
  # Requires that the 'tar' binary is present in your container
  # image.  If 'tar' is not present, 'kubectl cp' will fail.
  #
  # For advanced use cases, such as symlinks, wildcard expansion or
  # file mode preservation, consider using 'kubectl exec'.

Okay â€” was my first thought â€” I\'ll just install `tar` in the pod and then use `kubectl cp`!
But after a few attempts I realized that it's not worth the effort.
First of all, our highly size-optimized pods didn't have any proper package managers, only `microdnf`.

[souce, bash]
----
microdnf install tar
error: Failed to create: /var/cache/yum/metadata
----

Second, the environment prevented me from obraining the `root` user privileges on the pod and as a result the `microdnf` just didn't work.

Third, this is an ephemeral solution, a dirty and time-consuming hack.
I mean, even if I manage to get `tar` installed, this solution would not work in the future for other pods unless we add `tar` to the image.
I knew for sure that my team would not be happy with adding extra stuff to the image just for the sake of copying a file.

So I found the https://fabianlee.org/2022/09/10/kubernetes-copying-files-into-and-out-of-containers-without-kubectl-cp/[exec-cat-output-redirectin] hack.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl exec pod -- cat /tmp/dump.hprof > dump.hprof
----

Wrong!
And all those basterds got downvoted for wasting my time.

The problem is that the file is modified for some reason during the process.
I've spent hours praying that my Internet connection would not blink waiting for the file to be copied.
Yes, catting a gigabyte is ridiculously slow.
All I got was a broken heap dump: the `md5sum` of the original file and the one I got were different, the Memory Analyzer Tool was unable to open it.

Oh, that's expected â€” I thought â€” the file is binary, so `cat` is not the right tool for the job.
I should `base64` the damn thing!

[source, bash]
----
kubectl exec pod -- base64 /tmp/dump.hprof | base64 --decode > dump.hprof
----

Now I spent twice as much hours (`base64` is also slow) praying and waiting and all I gotâ€¦ was a broken heap dump again!

So, up to this point I tried these:

- `kubectl cp`.
- Install `tar` on a pod and then `kubectl cp`.
- `kubectl exec pod -- cat /tmp/dump.hprof > dump.hprof`
- `kubectl exec pod -- base64 /tmp/dump.hprof | base64 --decode > dump.hprof`

None of them worked and I was mad and despair.

I had one last idea: **find a simple web server capable of accepting uploads, run it on my laptop, expose it to the Internet through a tool like `ngrok`, and then `curl` the file from the pod to my laptop!**

.laptop
[source, bash]
----
python3 -m pip install --user uploadserver
python3 -m uploadserver
ngrok http 8000
----

.pod
[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST https://<my-ngrok.address>/upload -F 'files=@/tmp/dump.hprof'
----

And it did the job, quickly and reliably ðŸ¤—
