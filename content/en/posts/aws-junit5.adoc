Do you test the code that uses AWS services?
Do you use JUnit 5 in your tests?
If you do both, I may have something useful for you.

https://github.com/madhead/aws-junit5[JUnit 5 extensions for AWS]: a few JUnit 5 extensions that could be useful for testing AWS-related code.
These extensions can be used to inject clients for AWS service mocks provided by tools like https://github.com/localstack/localstack[localstack].
Both AWS Java SDK v 2.x and v 1.x are supported.

You may know (or you may imagine, if you never tried) that testing code that works with AWS is not easy.
Just mocking the clients is enough only for simple unit tests, it won't help you detect some service-specific issues like this:

[source, kotlin]
----
val kinesis: KinesisClient = …
    
kinesis.putRecord { 
    it.streamName("kinesis-stream")
    it.data(SdkBytes.fromString("payload", StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
}
----

What's wrong with this code?
If you mock the client, there are basically two outcomes: either it accepts your request or it fails.
But the real AWS service client will always fail.
Kinesis requires partition key:

[source, kotlin]
----
kinesis.putRecord { 
    it.streamName("kinesis-stream")
    it.partitionKey("partition-key") // this line is crucial!
    it.data(SdkBytes.fromString("payload", StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
}
----

This is true for every other AWS services: DynamoDB's `getItem` requires table name and key, S3 requires bucket and key for `putObject` and so on.

Here, at the level of integration testing, come tools like https://github.com/localstack/localstack[localstack], https://min.io[MinIO] or https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/08/use-amazon-dynamodb-local-more-easily-with-the-new-docker-image[DynamoDB Local].
The idea is to mock an AWS service using a low-cost, disposable (in-memory) implementation and use it to test your code.
Localstack already supports two dozen of AWS services and the list is growing!

You only have to get the clients in your test classes, and https://github.com/madhead/aws-junit5[`aws-junit5`] will help you do with a minimal effor:

[source, kotlin]
----
@ExtendWith(Kinesis::class)
class SomeTest {
    @AWSClient(endpoint = Endpoint::class)
    @AWSAdvancedConfiguration(sdkAsyncHttpClientFactory = HTTPConfiguration::class)
    private kinesis: KinesisAsyncClient

    @Test
    fun test() {
        kinesis.putRecord { 
            it.streamName("kinesis-stream")
            it.partitionKey("partition-key")
            it.data(SdkBytes.fromString("payload", StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
        }
    }
}
----

Here, `Endpoint` provides some vital values, taking them, for example, from the environment:

[source, kotlin]
----
class Endpoint : AWSEndpoint {
    override fun url() = System.getenv("DYNAMODB_URL")

    override fun region() = System.getenv("DYNAMODB_REGION")

    override fun accessKey() = System.getenv("DYNAMODB_ACCESS_KEY")

    override fun secretKey() = System.getenv("DYNAMODB_SECRET_KEY")
}
----

`HTTPConfiguration` is a bit of an optional configuration, needed in specific cases.
Like configuring HTTP protocol details:

[source, kotlin]
----
class HTTPConfiguration : SdkAsyncHttpClientFactory {
    override fun create() =
        NettyNioAsyncHttpClient
            .builder()
            .protocol(Protocol.HTTP1_1)
            .buildWithDefaults(
                AttributeMap
                    .builder()
                    .put(SdkHttpConfigurationOption.TRUST_ALL_CERTIFICATES, java.lang.Boolean.TRUE)
                    .build()
            )
}
----

In most cases only `@AWSClient` with `endpoint` is needed.
You can use https://github.com/madhead/aws-junit5[`aws-junit5`] to inject clients for DynamoDB, Kinesis, S3, SES, SNS and SQS.

Even if you use real AWS services for testing (i.e. you have a dedicated environment for tests) — you still can use these extensions to get the required clients.
