When I had to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html[configure Lambda Proxy Integrations in AWS API Gateway] for the second time for a week I thought about extracting Java classes in a small library for later reuse.

Bot https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html#api-gateway-simple-proxy-for-lambda-input-format[input] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html#api-gateway-simple-proxy-for-lambda-output-format[output] formats of a Lambda with Proxy Integration are well defined and described on AWS docs site.
However there is no reference implementation for any language available and developers have to implement those POJOs (speaking in Java terms) themselves over and over again.

So, I decided to publish yet-another-aws-lambda-proxy-integration-java-library, or simply https://gitlab.com/madhead/lambda-proxy-integration-java[lambda-proxy-integration-java].
It is https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter?filterByPkgName=by.dev.madhead.utils.lambda_proxy_integration_java%3Amodel[available via JCenter] by `by.dev.madhead.utils.lambda_proxy_integration_java:model:${version}` coordinates with only one line in your Gradle config (assuming you're already using `jcenter()` repo):
