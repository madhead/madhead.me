I'm working on a bunch of apps that need to verify AppStore receipts on a JVM-based server.
The process https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateRemotely.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH104-SW1[is described in Apples's Documentation Archive] but lacks of any SDK / libraries.
So I made one to improve code reuse.

I assume Jackson is the most popular and widely used JSON library in the JVM world, so the library depends on it for field mappings.
Guava is used for `equals` / `hashCode` / `toString` and that's it.
The library is https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter?filterByPkgName=by.dev.madhead.utils.appstore_receipts_validator%3Amodel[published to JCenter] and requires only one line in your Gradle build (assuming you're already using `jcenter()` repo):
